# Professional Linux Kernel Driver & Device Tree Development Services – 100% Remote

## Expert Linux Kernel Engineer Offering Custom Kernel Modules, Device Tree Overlays, PCIe/USB/I2C/SPI Drivers and Full Embedded Linux Bring-up

Your Yocto BSP is ready but the new sensor, display, PCIe card or custom hardware is not working?  
Getting kernel oops, NULL pointer or “no device found” errors?  

I deliver **production-ready Linux kernel drivers**, **Device Tree overlays**, **kernel modules**, **upstream patches** and complete hardware bring-up.  

**All services are 100% remote** via Git, logs, and TeamViewer — no shipping required.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can you write a driver for a completely new chip?**  
**A:** Yes — I specialize in bring-up of undocumented or new silicon.

**Q: Do you support mainline kernel or vendor kernels?**  
**A:** Both — mainline preferred, vendor kernels when required.

**Q: Can you fix a kernel oops remotely?**  
**A:** Yes — most oops/panics resolved within 1–2 days.

**Q: Do you provide DKMS or in-tree integration?**  
**A:** Both, depending on your production needs.
